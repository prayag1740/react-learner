node modules -- contains react dependencies
package json -- metadata , versions

Dom -- document object model; represents the entire UI of web application in a tree data structure
Whenever there is chnage in state of application, DOM is updated and it represents the change.

React maintains two virtual DOMs every time. The first one contains the updated virtual DOM, and the other is a pre-updated version of the updated virtual DOM. It compares the pre-updated version of the updated virtual DOM and finds what was changed in the DOM, like which components will be changed.
React uses batch updates to update the actual DOM. It changes to the actual DOM are sent in batches rather than sending any updates for the single change into the component's state.

JSX -- Javascript XML

Default exports can be used without curly braces when importing
Named exports which is a specific export variable should be used with curly braces when importing

CSS Styling
1) External import
2) Internal -- ie defining within that file
3) Inline -- done with style attribute and it's value must be a javascript object


function myname (name) {


}

2nd way to rewrite above function

const myname = (name) => {


}

1)map function can be used to iterate data in react
consists of parameters val, index

Syntax 
array.map(callback_function(currValue, index, arr), thisValue)

Example

<script>

const arr1 = ['prayag', 'bhatia', 'react'];

const arr2 = arr1.map(func (cvalue) => {
    return cvalue ;
})

</script>

2)Ternary operator syntax
condition ? expTrue : expFalse

3)Object destructing

let x = props.x ;
let y = props.y ;

let {x,y} = props ;

4) useState returns 2 things -- current data and updated data


5) Variable declaration
-> const -- for constants
-> let and var -- for again redeclaration
 let is being used instead of var

 6) setInterval -- takes a callback function and time interval after which it needs to be called 
    can be useful if we want to trigger function without a onclick of a button


7) three dots in React Javascript
7.1) Concatenating 2 arrays
const fullname = ['Vinod', 'Thapa']
const biodata = [1, 'abc' , ...fullname]

biodata === > [1, 'abc' ,'Vinod', 'Thapa']

8) Hooks
useState


9) button -> onClick
    input form --> onChange


10) Material UI icons
Installation -- npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react

11) Context API -- alternative to prop drilling ;
    allows to send data to child components from parent comp without passing prop to each level.
    Ex -- Parent Comp A -> Child Comp B -> Child Comp C -> Child Comp D
    Can directly pass components to child comp D without passing through B and C
    createContext ; provider ; consumer

    alternative is to use useCOntext Hook

12) useEffect -- what to perform after the render ; gets called on it's own
